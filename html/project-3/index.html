            <h1>Watchmen</h1>
            <p>Watchmen is a <span class="link">comic book limited series</span> by the British creative
            team of writer <span class="link">Alan Moore</span>, artist <span class="link">Dave Gibbons</span> and colorist
            <span class="link">John Higgins</span>. It was published monthly by <span class="link">DC Comics</span> in 1986 and 1987 before
            being collected in a single-volume edition in 1987. Watchmen
            originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring
            <span class="link">superhero</span> characters that the company had acquired from <span class="link">Charlton
            Comics</span>. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the
            characters unusable for future stories, managing editor <span class="link">Dick Giordano</span>
            convinced Moore to create original characters instead.</p>

            <p>Moore used the story as a means of reflecting contemporary
            anxieties, of deconstructing and satirizing the superhero concept and
            of making political commentary. Watchmen depicts an <span class="link">alternate history</span>
            in which superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence
            changed history so that the United States won the <span class="link">Vietnam War</span> and the
            <span class="link">Watergate scandal</span> was never exposed. In 1985 the country is edging
            toward <span class="link">World War III</span> with the <span class="link">Soviet Union</span>, freelance costumed
            vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in
            retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the
            protagonists' personal development and <span class="link">moral struggles</span> as an
            investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero
            pulls them out of retirement.</p>

            <p>It was subsequently collected in 1987 as a DC Comics trade
            paperback that has had at least 24 printings as of March 2017;[17]
            another <span class="link">trade paperback</span> was published by
            <span class="link">Warner Books</span>, a DC sister
            company, in 1987.<sup>[18]</sup> In February 1988, DC published a
            limited-edition, slipcased hardcover volume, produced by Graphitti
            Design, that contained 48 pages of bonus material, including the
            original proposal and concept art.<sup>[19][20]</sup> In 2005, DC released
            Absolute Watchmen, an oversized slipcased hardcover edition of the
            series in DC's <span class="link">Absolute Edition</span> format. Assembled under the
            supervision of Dave Gibbons, Absolute Watchmen included the Graphitti
            materials, as well as restored and recolored art by John Higgins.<sup>[21]</sup>
            That December DC published a new printing of Watchmen issue #1 at the
            original 1986 cover price of $1.50 as part of its "Millennium Edition"
            line.<sup>[22]</sup></p>

            <h2>Background and creation</h2>

            <p>In 1983, DC Comics acquired a line of characters from <span
              class="link">Charlton Comics</span>.<span class="link"><sup>[29]</sup></span>
            During that period, writer <span class="link">Alan Moore</span> contemplated
            writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he
            could revamp, as he had done in his <span class="link">Miracleman</span> series in the early
            1980s. Moore reasoned that <span class="link">MLJ Comics' Mighty Crusaders</span> might be
            available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot
            which would begin with the discovery of the body of the <span class="link">Shield</span> in a
            harbor. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he
            ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them "so it would
            have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of
            these characters was".<span class="link"><sup>[28]</sup></span> Moore used this premise and crafted a
            proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the
            <span class="link">Peacemaker</span>,<span class="link"><sup>[30]</sup></span> and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC
            managing editor <span class="link">Dick Giordano</span>.<span
                                  class="link"><sup>[31]</sup></span> Giordano was receptive to the
            proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for
            the story. After the acquisition of Charlton's Action Hero line, DC
            intended to use their upcoming <span class="link">Crisis on Infinite Earths</span> event to
            fold them into their mainstream superhero universe. Moore said, "DC
            realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or
            dysfunctional." Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue his
            project but with new characters that simply resembled the Charlton
            heroes.<span class="link"><sup>[32][33][34]</sup></span> Moore had initially believed that original
            characters would not provide emotional resonance for readers but
            later changed his mind. He said, "Eventually, I realized that if I
            wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed
            familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a
            kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader,
            then it might work."<span class="link"><sup>[28]</sup></span></p>
